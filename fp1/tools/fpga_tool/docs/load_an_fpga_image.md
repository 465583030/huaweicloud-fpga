Loading an FPGA Image
=====================
[切换到中文版](./load_an_fpga_image_cn.md)


FpgaCmdEntry, FPGA image loading tool, supports FPGA information query, image loading, loading status query and virtual LED status query.

Procedure
---------------------

**Step 1**:  Run the `ls /usr/local/bin/FpgaCmdEntry` command to check that the FPGA image loading tool exists.

    [root@fpga_01]# ls /usr/local/bin/FpgaCmdEntry 
	/usr/local/bin/FpgaCmdEntry
> If the tool does not exist,  please see the chapter of compliling and installing in [fpga_tool README](./../README.md).

**Step 2**: Run the `FpgaCmdEntry DF -D` command to check that there are FPGA devices on the VM. If the value of DeviceId is 0xd503, the device in the current example is a high-perform device. If the value of DeviceId is 0xd512, the device in the current example is a general-purpose device.

	[root@fpga_01]# FpgaCmdEntry DF -D 
	----------------FPGA Information------------------
	     Type			           Fpga Device
	     Slot			           0
	     VendorId			       0x19e5
	     DeviceId			       0xd503
	     DBDF			           0000:00:06.0
	 --------------------------------------------------
	Command execution is complete. 
	
	[root@fpga_02]# FpgaCmdEntry DF -D 
	----------------FPGA Information------------------
	     Type			           Fpga Device
	     Slot			           0
	     VendorId			       0x19e5
	     DeviceId			       0xd512
	     DBDF			           0000:00:06.0
	 -------------------------------------------------- 
	Command execution is complete.


**Step 3**: Run the **FpgaCmdEntry IF -S** *Slot* command to check whether an FPGA image is loaded to the FPGA device in each slot. If the value of **LoadStatusName** is **NOT_PROGRAMMED**, no image is loaded.

**Slot**: Indicates the slot number of the FPGA, which is the slot number of the device that is queried.

	[root@fpga_01]# FpgaCmdEntry IF -S 0

	     LoadErrCode		        0
	     Shell ID			       01010021
	 --------------------------------------------------
	Command execution is complete. 
	
	[root@fpga_02]# FpgaCmdEntry IF -S 0

	     LoadStatusName		     NOT_PROGRAMMED
	     LoadStatusCode		     0
	     LoadErrName		        OK
	     LoadErrCode		        0
	     Shell ID			       01210002
	 --------------------------------------------------
	Command execution is complete.


**Step 4**: Run the **FpgaCmdEntry LF -S** *Slot* **-I** *ImageId* command to load an image to an FPGA device.

**Slot** :Indicates the slot number of the FPGA, which is the slot number of the device that is queried.

**ImageId**: AEI id indicates the AEI number, which is the FPGA image ID generated by Compiling.

	[root@fpga_02]# FpgaCmdEntry LF -S 0 -I ff8080825e9**********74851ee0023
	Command execution is complete.

**Step 5**: Run the **FpgaCmdEntry IF -S** *slot* command to check whether the image is loaded successfully.If the value of **LoadStutusName** is **LOADED**, the image is loaded successfully.

	[root@fpga_01]# FpgaCmdEntry IF -S 0

	 -------------------------------------------------- 
	Command execution is complete.


**Step 6 (not necessary)**: Run the **FpgaCmdEntry IL -S** *Slot* command that can check the LED status of the corresponding slot,the LED status value is set by the user when loading PR.The LED status query can be used to confirm whether the image function loaded is normal or not. When the query result is consistent with the settings, the image function is normal. Note that the universal device does not support LED status query.
	[root@fpga_01]# FpgaCmdEntry IL -S 0 
	LED Status(H): 0x0 
	LED Status(H): 0000|0000|0000|0000|0000|0000|0000|0000 
	Command execution is complete. 
	
	[root@fpga_02]# FpgaCmdEntry IL -S 0 
	General purpose architecture device doesn't support user LED.
	Command execution is complete.
